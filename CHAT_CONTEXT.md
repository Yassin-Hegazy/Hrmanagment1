# Development Session Context

This file summarizes the recent work and architectural decisions for teammates joining the project.

## 📅 Last Updated: December 2025

## 🚧 Recent Work Accomplished
1.  **Project Initialization**: Initialized Git repository and pushed to GitHub.
2.  **Database Refactoring**:
    *   Moved scattered SQL files into a clean `DBscripts` folder.
    *   Consolidated scripts into `tables.sql` (schema) and `procedures.sql` (logic).
3.  **Documentation**: Added `README.md` with strict setup instructions.

## 🏗 System Architecture Notes
*   **Database Approach**: We are **NOT** using Entity Framework Migrations for database structure. We are using **SQL Scripts** (`DBscripts/*.sql`).
*   **Identity**: Custom `AuthenticationService` (not default ASP.NET Identity).
*   **Frontend**: ASP.NET Core MVC with Razor Views.

## ⚠️ Critical Setup Info for Teammates
*   **Do NOT change `appsettings.json`**: It is set to `(localdb)`.
*   **For SQL Express**: Create `appsettings.Development.json` and put your connection string there.
*   **First Run**: You **MUST** run `DBscripts/tables.sql` then `DBscripts/procedures.sql` manually in SSMS or Visual Studio to create the database.

## 📝 Next Steps (To-Do)
*   [ ] Verify the `EmployeeController` integration with the new stored procedures.
*   [ ] Test the "Line Manager", "HR Admin", and "System Admin" role logic.
*   [ ] Implement the `Contract` views functionality.
